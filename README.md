## Ô∏è Hi there!

My name is Johan, known as Desvo, and I'm a quest to become an indie game developer.

Fueled by a passion for video games, independent creation, I'm actively learning to bring my game ideas to life and explore web and software development possibilities. 

In the meantime, I'm always scouring online resources to expand my programming knowledge and explore the magic of software development.  

Looking forward to connecting with other developers and embarking on this exciting journey together!
