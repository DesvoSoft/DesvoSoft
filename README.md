## Ô∏è Hi there!

My name is Johan, known as Desvo, and I'm on a quest to become an indie game developer.

Fueled by a passion for video games, independent creation, I'm learning to bring my ideas to life and explore web and software development possibilities. 

**Languages:**

* Python
* JavaScript (JS)
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
